Self-Evaluation:
I think that out of all the games we had to do for this class, this was probably the most challenging for me. The thing that troubled me
the most was the UI and more specifically, UI related to horizontal and vertical layout groups. One issue that took me a while to fix was an
overlapping button issue. I managed to fix it using a very roundabout method: I created different button layouts for each group of buttons that
would appear at the same time and then manually loaded them into the game using separate methods for each button. This issue took me about a 
whole two weeks to figure out (mostly because I spent most of the time trying to work with the layout group). It also seems like I didn't really
do much to the layout other than slap an image to the back and put a few elements in front, but once again, this is because it took me a really long time 
to figure out how to make a good layout, since the layout groups I worked with restricted me in terms of format. 

I think I did a good job in terms of the text. I like the way I divided it and used the typewriter effect to make it come to life on the screen. I also
really liked the images I found online. I think they work well together to create a visual novel type of aesthetic. If I had more time, I would actually
add tags to the character lines and draw on the images to show character emotion (ex. Dana getting annoyed by Donna's 5435 questions). I think that the 
art worked well with the music. Since the music itself is supposed to be soothing, I decided to get rid of the annoying boops and beeps and instead made
all characters speak with the same generic beeps. Playtesters said that this worked better and I hope it detracts less from the game now. 

Overall, I put a lot of work into this game and honestly, I could have done so much more in the timeframe we had if I asked for help sooner. I think I did a
decent job, but I would definitely improve what I have if given an extra week or so.
